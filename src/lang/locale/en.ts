        To improve Obsidian's startup time and manage the large <strong>CJK font family</strong>, 
        I've moved the CJK fonts out of the plugin's <code>main.js</code>. CJK fonts will be loaded from the internet by default.
        This typically shouldn't cause issues as Obsidian caches these files after first use.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you prefer to keep Obsidian 100% local or experience performance issues, you can download the font assets.
      </p>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the fonts from <a href="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/raw/refs/heads/master/assets/excalidraw-fonts.zip">GitHub</a>.</li>
        <li>Unzip and copy files into a Vault folder (default: <code>Excalidraw/${CJK_FONTS}</code>; folder names are cAse-senSITive).</li>
        <li><mark>DO NOT</mark> set this folder to the Vault root or mix with other local fonts.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>For Obsidian Sync Users:</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure Obsidian Sync is set to synchronize "All other file types" or download and unzip the file on all devices.
      </p>
      <h3>Note:</h3>
      <p>
        If you find this process cumbersome, please submit a feature request to Obsidian.md for supporting assets in the plugin folder. 
        Currently, only a single <code>main.js</code> is supported, which leads to large files and slow startup times for complex plugins like Excalidraw. 
        I apologize for the inconvenience.
