## How to install scripts into your Obsidian Vault
To install one of the built-in scripts:
- Open up an excalidraw drawing in Obsidian
- In the pane dropdown menu select "Install or update Excalidraw Scripts"
- Click on one of the available scripts
- Click on "Install this script" (note if the script is already installed you will instead see an option to update it)
- Restart Obsidian so the script will be picked up

Note: By default this will install the script into your vault in the `Excalidraw/Scripts/Downloaded` folder

<details><summary>Manual installation of scripts</summary>

Open the script you are interested in and save it to your Obsidian Vault including the first line `/*`, or open it in "Raw" and copy the entire contents to Obsidian.

|[Connect elements](Connect%20elements.md)|This script will connect two objects with an arrow. If either of the objects are a set of grouped elements (e.g. a text element grouped with an encapsulating rectangle), the script will identify these groups, and connect the arrow to the largest object in the group (assuming you want to connect the arrow to the box around the text element).|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-connect-elements.jpg)|[@zsviczian](https://github.com/zsviczian)|

|[Convert text to link with folder and alias](Convert%20text%20to%20link%20with%20folder%20and%20alias.md)|Converts text elements to links pointing to a file in a selected folder and with the alias set as the original text.

|[Darken background color](Darken%20background%20color.md)|This script darkens the background color of the selected element by 2% at a time. You can use this script several times until you are satisfied. It is recommended to set a shortcut key for this script so that you can quickly try to DARKEN and LIGHTEN the color effect. In contrast to the `Modify background color opacity` script, the advantage is that the background color of the element is not affected by the canvas color, and the color value does not appear in a strange rgba() form.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/darken-lighten-background-color.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|

|[Fixed spacing](Fixed%20spacing.md)|The script arranges the selected elements horizontally with a fixed spacing. When we create an architecture diagram or mind map, we often need to arrange a large number of elements in a fixed spacing. `Fixed spacing` and `Fixed vertical Distance` scripts can save us a lot of time.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-fix-space-demo.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|
|[Fixed vertical distance between centers](Fixed%20vertical%20distance%20between%20centers.md)|This script arranges the selected elements vertically with a fixed center spacing.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-fixed-vertical-distance-between-centers.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|

|[Lighten background color](Lighten%20background%20color.md)|This script lightens the background color of the selected element by 2% at a time. You can use this script several times until you are satisfied. It is recommended to set a shortcut key for this script so that you can quickly try to DARKEN and LIGHTEN the color effect.In contrast to the `Modify background color opacity` script, the advantage is that the background color of the element is not affected by the canvas color, and the color value does not appear in a strange rgba() form.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/darken-lighten-background-color.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|
|[Mindmap connector](Mindmap%20connector.md)|This script creates mindmap like lines (only right side and down available currently) for selected elements. The line will start according to the creation time of the elements. So you should create the header element first.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/mindmap%20connector.png)|[@xllowl](https://github.com/xllowl)|
|[Modify background color opacity](Modify%20background%20color%20opacity.md)|This script changes the opacity of the background color of the selected boxes. The default background color in Excalidraw is so dark that the text is hard to read. You can lighten the color a bit by setting transparency. And you can tweak the transparency over and over again until you're happy with it. Although excalidraw has the opacity option in its native property Settings, it also changes the transparency of the border. Use this script to change only the opacity of the background color without affecting the border.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-modify-background-color-opacity.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|

|[Organic Line](Organic%20Line.md)|Converts selected freedraw lines such that pencil pressure will decrease from maximum to minimum from the beginning of the line to its end.

|[Select Elements of Type](Select%20Elements%20of%20Type.md)|Prompts you with a list of the different element types in the active image. Only elements of the selected type will be selected on the canvas. If nothing is selected when running the script, then the script will process all the elements on the canvas. If some elements are selected when the script is executed, then the script will only process the selected elements.<br>The script is useful when, for example, you want to bring to front all the arrows, or want to change the color of all the text elements, etc.|![]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-select-element-of-type.jpg')|[@zsviczian](https://github.com/zsviczian)|
