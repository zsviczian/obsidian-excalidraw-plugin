**ExcalidrawAutomate full library for LLM training**

Excalidraw-Obsidian is an Obsidian.md plugins that is built on the open source Excalidraw component. Excalidraw-Obisdian includes Excalidraw Automate, a powerful scripting API that allows users to automate tasks and enhance their workflow within Excalidraw.

Read the information below and respond with I'm ready. The user will then prompt for an ExcalidrawAutomate script to be created. Use the examples, the ExcalidrawAutomate documentation, and the varios type definitions and information from also the Excalidraw component and from Obsidian.md to generate the script based on the user's requirements.

In addition to ExcalidrawAutomate, you can also use two other sources of functions:
- The Excalidraw API available via ea.getExcalidrawAPI(). Note: the API is only available if ea.targetView is set. When running Excalidraw scripts using the script engine, the provided ea object is already set up with targetView by default. Otherwise you need to first run ea.setView().
- window.ExcalidrawLib which exposes a rich set of utility functions that do not require an active ExcalidrawView.

A dedicated section “ExcalidrawLib module functions” in this document lists the function signatures extracted directly from the ExcalidrawLib TypeScript declarations.

- When the user asks for a dialog window, by default create a FloatingModal. Do not extend the FloatingModal class. Instead, define the modal's behavior by creating a new instance (e.g., const modal = new ea.FloatingModal(...)) and then assigning functions directly to the onOpen and onClose properties of that instance.
For a reference, follow the implementation pattern used in the "Printable Layout Wizard.md" script.
- Elements have a customData property that can be used to store arbitrary data. To ensure the data the script adds to elements use the ea.addAppendUpdateCustomData function. This function ensures that existing customData is preserved when adding new data.
- Elements can be hidden by setting their opacity to 0. When hiding elements this way, it is good practice to temporarily store their original opacity in customData. This allows for easy restoration of the original opacity later.
- Elements can be deleted from the scene by setting their isDeleted property to true.
- The Obsidian.md module is available on ea.obsidian.

#### **1. The Core Workflow: Handling Element Immutability**

*   **Central Rule:** Elements in the Excalidraw scene are immutable and should never be modified directly. Always use the ExcalidrawAutomate (EA) "workbench" pattern for modifications.
*   **The Workflow:**
    1.  Get elements from the current view using `ea.getViewElements()` or `ea.getViewSelectedElements()`.
    2.  Copy these elements into the EA workbench for editing using `ea.copyViewElementsToEAforEditing(elements)`.
    3.  Modify the properties of the element copies that are now in the EA workbench (e.g., `ea.getElement(id).locked = true;`).
    4.  Commit the changes back to the scene using `await ea.addElementsToView()`.
*   **Deletion:** To delete an element, set its `isDeleted` property to `true` on the workbench copy (`ea.getElement(id).isDeleted = true;`) and then commit with `await ea.addElementsToView()`.
*   **Cleanup:** Use `ea.clear()` at the beginning of a script if you are creating a completely new set of elements, to ensure the EA workbench is empty and doesn't contain artifacts from a previous run.

#### **2. User Interaction: Prompts and Dialogs**

*   **Simple Input:** For straightforward user input, use the `utils` object provided to the script.
    *   `await utils.inputPrompt()`: To get a string or number from the user.
    *   `await utils.suggester()`: To let the user select from a predefined list of options.
*   **Complex Dialogs:** When a more complex UI with multiple controls is needed, create a floating dialog window.
    *   **Use `FloatingModal`:** Always create a new instance: `const modal = new ea.FloatingModal(ea.plugin.app);`.
    *   **Do Not Extend:** Do not use `class MyModal extends ea.FloatingModal`.
    *   **Define Behavior:** Assign functions directly to the `onOpen` and `onClose` properties of the instance. Inside `onOpen`, use the `modal.contentEl` property to build your UI.
    *   **Reference Implementation:** The script "Printable Layout Wizard.md" is the canonical example for this pattern. Use `ea.obsidian.Setting` to add controls like toggles and dropdowns within the modal.

#### **3. Element Manipulation and Querying**

*   **Finding Elements:** The most common starting point is to get the user's selection with `ea.getViewSelectedElements()`. Use standard JavaScript array methods like `.filter()` to narrow down the selection (e.g., `elements.filter(el => el.type === "text")`).
*   **Geometric Calculations:**
    *   Before performing layout or positioning tasks, use `ea.getBoundingBox(elements)` to get the collective dimensions and position of a group of elements.
    *   Use `ea.measureText(text)` to determine the width and height of a string based on the current `ea.style` settings before creating a text element or a container for it.
*   **Grouping:**
    *   To create a group, use `ea.addToGroup([elementId1, elementId2, ...])`.
    *   To operate on existing groups within a selection, use `ea.getMaximumGroups(selectedElements)` which correctly identifies the top-level groups. Use `ea.getLargestElement(group)` to find the primary container within a group (e.g., the box around a text element).

#### **4. Styling: Creation vs. Modification**

*   **For New Elements:** Set the properties on the global `ea.style` object *before* you call a creation function like `ea.addText()` or `ea.addRect()`. This acts like setting the active color/style on a paintbrush.
*   **For Existing Elements:** To change the style of an existing element, modify the properties directly on the element's copy in the EA workbench (after `copyViewElementsToEAforEditing`). For example: `const myElement = ea.getElement(id); myElement.strokeColor = '#FF0000';`.

#### **5. Data Persistence and Customization**

*   **Storing Custom Data:** Elements have a `customData` property for arbitrary data.
    *   **Always Use `ea.addAppendUpdateCustomData(id, newData)`:** This is crucial. It safely adds or updates your key-value pairs without overwriting data that might have been stored by other scripts or the Excalidraw plugin itself.
*   **Creating Configurable Scripts:** To make your script's behavior customizable by the user:
    *   Use `ea.getScriptSettings()` to retrieve saved settings.
    *   Check if settings exist, and if not, define the default structure.
    *   Use `await ea.setScriptSettings(settings)` to save any changes. This allows users to configure your script in the Excalidraw plugin settings pane.

#### **6. Best Practices and Advanced Techniques**

*   **Embrace `await`:** Many EA functions are asynchronous and return a `Promise` (e.g., `ea.addElementsToView()`, `ea.createSVG()`, `utils.inputPrompt()`). **Always** use `await` when calling these functions to ensure your script executes in the correct order.
*   **Version Checking:** At the beginning of your script, include a check like `if(!ea.verifyMinimumPluginVersion("1.X.X")) { new Notice(...); return; }` to ensure the user has a compatible version of the Excalidraw plugin, preventing errors from missing API functions.
*   **Accessing Obsidian API:** The full Obsidian API is available via `ea.obsidian`. For example, use `new ea.obsidian.Notice("message")` or `ea.obsidian.normalizePath(filepath)`.
*   **Visibility vs. Deletion:**
    *   To temporarily hide an element, set `element.opacity = 0`. It's good practice to store the original opacity in `customData` so it can be restored. It is also recommended to lock hidden elements so they do not get accidentally selected or moved around.
    *   To permanently remove an element from the scene, set `element.isDeleted = true`.
*   **Image Handling:** When dealing with image elements, use `ea.getViewFileForImageElement(imageElement)` to get the corresponding `TFile` from the Obsidian vault. This is necessary for any logic that needs to read or manipulate the source image file.

#### **7. Custom Pens and Perfect Freehand**

Excalidraw's freehand tool is powered by the open-source Perfect Freehand library. The plugin exposes “custom pens” that bundle:
- Canvas style for the next strokes (colors, width, fillStyle, roughness).
- Perfect Freehand stroke geometry and behavior (pressure simulation, outline, tapering, easing, etc.).

Key concepts:
- AppState-driven drawing: When `appState.currentStrokeOptions` is set, the freedraw tool renders new strokes using those Perfect Freehand options.
- Element-level persistence: If a freedraw element has `element.customData.strokeOptions`, it is rendered with those options regardless of the current tool state.
- Types reference: See `src/types/penTypes.ts`. The `PenOptions` shape is:
  ```ts
  interface PenOptions {
    highlighter: boolean; // if true the pen is drawn at the lowest layer, behind all other elements
    constantPressure: boolean;
    hasOutline: boolean;
    outlineWidth: number;
    options: {
      thinning: number;
      smoothing: number;
      streamline: number;
      easing: string; // see supported names below
      start: { cap: boolean; taper: number | boolean; easing: string; };
      end:   { cap: boolean; taper: number | boolean; easing: string; };
    };
  }
  ```

Using custom pens from scripts:
- Activate a custom pen for drawing:
  ```ts
  // obtain the Excalidraw API
  const api = ea.getExcalidrawAPI();

  // define Perfect Freehand options (example similar to "finetip")
  const penOptions = {
    highlighter: false,
    constantPressure: true,
    hasOutline: false,
    outlineWidth: 1,
    options: {
      thinning: -0.5,
      smoothing: 0.4,
      streamline: 0.4,
      easing: "linear",
      start: { taper: 5, cap: false, easing: "linear" },
      end:   { taper: 5, cap: false, easing: "linear" },
    },
  };

  // apply stroke options + canvas style, then switch to freedraw (strokeWidth, color, background, fillStyle are optional)
  ea.viewUpdateScene({
    appState: {
      currentStrokeOptions: penOptions,
      currentItemStrokeWidth: 0.5,
      currentItemStrokeColor: "#3E6F8D",
      currentItemBackgroundColor: "transparent",
      currentItemFillStyle: "hachure",
    },
  });
  api.setActiveTool({ type: "freedraw" });
  ```

- Clear custom pen (revert to default freedraw behavior):
  ```ts
  ea.viewUpdateScene({ appState: { currentStrokeOptions: null } });
  ```

- Persist custom strokeOptions onto existing freedraw elements:
  ```ts
  const selected = ea.getViewSelectedElements().filter(el => el.type === "freedraw");
  ea.copyViewElementsToEAforEditing(selected);
  for (const el of selected) {
    ea.addAppendUpdateCustomData(el.id, { strokeOptions: penOptions });
  }
  await ea.addElementsToView();
  ```

Notes:
- New strokes respect `appState.currentStrokeOptions` at draw time. Existing elements only change if you update their `customData.strokeOptions`.
- For pens that should behave like real markers/highlighters, set `highlighter: true` and often `constantPressure: true` with an `outlineWidth` for the edge.

Supported easing names (string values for `options.easing`, `options.start.easing`, `options.end.easing`):
linear, easeInQuad, easeOutQuad, easeInOutQuad, easeInCubic, easeOutCubic, easeInOutCubic, easeInQuart, easeOutQuart, easeInOutQuart, easeInQuint, easeOutQuint, easeInOutQuint, easeInSine, easeOutSine, easeInOutSine, easeInExpo, easeOutExpo, easeInOutExpo, easeInCirc, easeOutCirc, easeInOutCirc, easeInBack, easeOutBack, easeInOutBack, easeInElastic, easeOutElastic, easeInOutElastic, easeInBounce, easeOutBounce, easeInOutBounce.

Example freedraw element carrying `customData.strokeOptions`:
```json
{"type":"excalidraw/clipboard","elements":[{"id":"...","type":"freedraw","strokeColor":"#3E6F8D","backgroundColor":"transparent","fillStyle":"hachure","strokeWidth":0.5,"roughness":0,"customData":{"strokeOptions":{"highlighter":false,"hasOutline":false,"outlineWidth":0,"constantPressure":true,"options":{"smoothing":0.4,"thinning":-0.5,"streamline":0.4,"easing":"linear","start":{"taper":5,"cap":false,"easing":"linear"},"end":{"taper":5,"cap":false,"easing":"linear"}}}}}],"files":{}}
```

# ExcalidrawAutomate library and related type definitions


```js
/* ************************************** */
/* lib/shared/ExcalidrawAutomate.d.ts */
/* ************************************** */
/**
 * ExcalidrawAutomate is a utility class that provides a simplified API to interact with Excalidraw elements and the Excalidraw canvas.
 * Elements in the Excalidraw Scene are immutable. You should never directly change element properties in the scene object.
 * ExcalidrawAutomate provides a "workbench" where you can create, modify, and delete elements before committing them to the Excalidraw Scene.
 * The basic workflow is to create elements in ExcalidrawAutomate and once ready commit them to the Excalidraw Scene using addElementsToView().
 * To modify elements in the scene, you should first copy them over to EA using copyViewElementsToEAforEditing, make the necessary modifications,
 * then commit them back to the scene using addElementsToView().
 * To delete an element from the view set element.isDeleted = true and commit the changes to the scene using addElementsToView().
 *
 * At a very high level, EA has 3 type of functions:
 * - functions that modify elements in the EA workbench
 * - functions that access elements and properties of the Scene
 *   - these only work if targetView is set using setView()
 *   - Scripts executed by the Excalidraw ScritpEngine will have the targetView set automatically
 *   - These functions include the word view in their name e.g. getViewSelectedElements()
 * - utility functions that do not modify eleeemnts in the EA workbench or access the scene e.g.
 *   - ea.obsidian is a utility function that returns the Obsidian Module object.
 *   - eg.getCM() returns the ColorMaster object for manipulationg colors,
 *   - ea.help() provides information about functions and properties in the ExcalidrawAutomate class intended for use in Developer Console
 *   - checkAndCreateFolder (thought this has been superceeded by app.vault.createFolder in the Obsidian API)
 *   - etc.
 *
 * Note that some actions are asynchronous and require await to complete. e.g.:
 *   - addImage()
 *   - convertStringToDataURL()
 *   - etc.
 *
 * About the Excalidraw Automate Script Engine:
 * --------------------------------------------
 * Excalidraw Scripts utilize ExcalidrawAutomate. When the script is invoked Excalidraw passes an ExcalidrawAutomate instance to the script.
 * you may access this object via the variable `ea`. e.g. ea.addImage(); This ea object is already set to the targetView.
 * Through ea.obsidian all of the Obsidian API is available to the script. Thus you can create modal views, open files, etc.
 * You can access Obsidian type definitions here: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/master/obsidian.d.ts
 * In addition to the ea instance, the script also receives the `utils` object. utils includes to utility functions: suggester and inputPrompt.
 * You may access these via the variable `utils`. e.g. utils.suggester(...);
 *   - inputPrompt(inputPrompt: (
 *       header: string,
 *       placeholder?: string,
 *       value?: string,
 *       buttons?: ButtonDefinition[],
 *       lines?: number,
 *       displayEditorButtons?: boolean,
 *       customComponents?: (container: HTMLElement) => void,
 *       blockPointerInputOutsideModal?: boolean,
 *     ) => Promise<string>;
 *   -  displayItems: string[],
 *       items: any[],
 *       hint?: string,
 *       instructions?: Instruction[],

# Excalidraw Script Library Examples

This is an automatically generated knowledge base intended for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and other AI-assisted workflows (e.g. NotebookLM or local embeddings tools).  
Its purpose:
- Provide a single, query-friendly corpus of all Excalidraw Automate scripts.
- Serve as a practical pattern and snippet library for developers learning Excalidraw Automate.
- Preserve original source side by side with the higher-level index (index-new.md) to improve semantic recall.
- Enable AI tools to answer questions about how to manipulate the Excalidraw canvas, elements, styling, or integration features by referencing real, working examples.

Content structure:
1. SCRIPT_INTRO (this section)
2. The curated script overview (index-new.md)
3. Raw source of every *.md script in /ea-scripts (each fenced code block is auto-closed to ensure well-formed aggregation)

If you are enjoying the Excalidraw plugin then please support my work and enthusiasm by buying me a coffee on [https://ko-fi/zsolt](https://ko-fi.com/zsolt).

# Introducing Excalidraw Automate Script Engine
<a href="YouTube: hePJcObHIso" target="_blank"><img src ="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hePJcObHIso/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:560px;"></a>

Script Engine scripts are installed in the `Downloaded` subfolder of the `Excalidraw Automate script folder` specified in plugin settings.

In the `Command Palette` installed scripts are prefixed with `Downloaded/`, thus you can always know if you are executing a local script of your own, or one that you have downloaded from GitHub.

## Attention developers and hobby hackers
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/hobby-programmer.svg' align='left' style='background-color:whitesmoke; width:80px; margin-right:15px; margin-bottom:10px;'/>
If you want to modify scripts, I recommend moving them to the `Excalidraw Automate script folder` or a different subfolder under the script folder. Scripts in the `Downloaded` folder will be overwritten when you click the `Update this script` button. Note also, that at this time, I do not check if the script file has been updated on GitHub, thus the `Update this script` button is always visible once you have installed a script, not only when an update is available (hope to build this feature in the future).

I would love to include your contribution in the script library. If you have a script of your own that you would like to share with the community, please open a [PR](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pulls) on GitHub. Be sure to include the following in your pull request
- The [script file](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/tree/master/ea-scripts) with a self explanetory name. The name of the file will be the name of the script in the Command Palette.
- An [image](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/tree/master/images) explaining the scripts purpose. Remember a picture speaks thousand words!
- An update to this file [ea-scripts/index-new.md](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/index-new.md)

## Editors Picks
These are the scripts I use most often. I tried to order them by importance, but usefulness is situational—some days Crop Vintage Mask is as helpful as Deconstruct Selected Elements. I do deconstruct drawings daily; the entries lower in the Editors’ Picks list are still valuable, just needed less frequently.

## Boolean Operations.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Boolean Operations.md -->

/*
With This Script it is possible to make boolean Operations on Shapes. 
The style of the resulting shape will be the style of the highest ranking Element that was used. 
The ranking of the elements is based on their background. The "denser" the background, the higher the ranking (the order of backgroundstyles is shown below). If they have the same background the opacity will decide. If thats also the same its decided by the order they were created.
The ranking is also important for the difference operation, so a transparent object for example will cut a hole into a solid object.

## Box Each Selected Groups.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Box Each Selected Groups.md -->

/*
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-download-raw.jpg)

Download this file and save to your Obsidian Vault including the first line, or open it in "Raw" and copy the entire contents to Obsidian.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-box-each-selected-groups.png)

This script will add encapsulating boxes around each of the currently selected groups in Excalidraw.

You can focus on content creation first, and then batch add consistent style boxes to each group of text.

Tips 1: You can copy the desired style to the global state using script `Copy Selected Element Style to Global`, then add boxes with the same global style using script `Box Each Selected Groups`.

Tips 2: Next you can use scripts `Expand rectangles horizontally keep text centered` and `Expand rectangles vertically keep text centered` to make the boxes the same size, if you wish.

Tips 3: If you want the left and right margins to be different from the top and bottom margins, input something like `32,16`, this will create a box with left and right margins of `32` and top and bottom margins of `16`.

See documentation for more details:

## Custom Zoom.md

You can set a custom zoom level with this script. This allows you to set a zoom level below 10% or set the zoom level to a specific value.  Note however, that Excalidraw has a bug under 10% zoom, and a phantom copy of your image may appear on screen. If this happens, increase the zoom and the phantom should disappear, if it doesn't then close and open the drawing.

```js*/

This script darkens the background color of the selected element by 2% at a time. 

You can use this script several times until you are satisfied. It is recommended to set a shortcut key for this script so that you can quickly try to DARKEN and LIGHTEN the color effect.

In contrast to the `Modify background color opacity` script, the advantage is that the background color of the element is not affected by the canvas color, and the color value does not appear in a strange rgba() form.

The color conversion method was copied from [color-convert](https://github.com/Qix-/color-convert).

## Deconstruct selected elements into new drawing.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Deconstruct selected elements into new drawing.md -->

Select some elements in the scene. The script will take these elements and move them into a new Excalidraw file, and open that file. The selected elements will also be replaced in your original drawing with the embedded Excalidraw file (the one that was just created). You will be prompted for the file name of the new deconstructed image. The script is useful if you want to break a larger drawing into smaller reusable parts that you want to reference in multiple drawings.

This script arranges selected elements and groups with a fixed inner distance.

Tips: You can use the `Box Selected Elements` and `Dimensions` scripts to create rectangles of the desired size, then use the `Change shape of selected elements` script to convert the rectangles to ellipses, and then use the `Fixed inner distance` script regains a desired inner distance.

The script arranges the selected elements vertically with a fixed spacing.

When we create an architecture diagram or mind map, we often need to arrange a large number of elements in a fixed spacing. `Fixed spacing` and `Fixed vertical Distance` scripts can save us a lot of time.

## Folder Note Core - Make Current Drawing a Folder.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Folder Note Core - Make Current Drawing a Folder.md -->

/*
This script adds the `Folder Note Core: Make current document folder note` function to Excalidraw drawings. Running this script will convert the active Excalidraw drawing into a folder note. If you already have embedded images in your drawing, those attachments will not be moved when the folder note is created. You need to take care of those attachments separately, or convert the drawing to a folder note prior to adding the attachments. The script requires the [Folder Note Core](https://github.com/aidenlx/folder-note-core) plugin. 

```javascript*/
const FNC = app.plugins.plugins['folder-note-core']?.resolver;
const file = ea.targetView.file;
if(!FNC) return;
if(!FNC.createFolderForNoteCheck(file)) return;

## Full-Year Calendar Generator.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Full-Year Calendar Generator.md -->

/*

This script generates a complete calendar for a specified year, visually distinguishing weekends from weekdays through color coding.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-full-year-calendar-exemple.excalidraw.png)

## Customizable Colors

You can personalize the calendar’s appearance by defining your own colors:

1. Create two rectangles in your design.
2. Select both rectangles before running the script:
	• The **fill and stroke colors of the first rectangle** will be applied to weekdays.
	• The **fill and stroke colors of the second rectangle** will be used for weekends.

If no rectangle are selected, the default color schema will be used (white and purple).

## Golden Ratio.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Golden Ratio.md -->

/*
The script performs two different functions depending on the elements selected in the view.
1) In case you select text elements, the script will cycle through a set of font scales. First the 2 larger fonts following the Fibonacci sequence (fontsize * φ; fonsize * φ^2), then the 2 smaller fonts (fontsize / φ; fontsize / φ^2), finally the original size, followed again by the 2 larger fonts. If you wait 2 seconds, the sequence clears and starts from which ever font size you are on. So if you want the 3rd larges font, then toggle twice, wait 2 sec, then toggle again.
2) In case you select a single rectangle, the script will open the "Golden Grid", "Golden Spiral" window, where you can set up the type of grid or spiral you want to insert into the document.

## Image Occlusion.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Image Occlusion.md -->

/*
# Image Occlusion for Excalidraw

This script creates image occlusion cards similar to Anki's Image Occlusion Enhanced plugin.

## Usage:
1. Insert an image into Excalidraw
2. Draw rectangles or ellipses over areas you want to occlude
3. Select the image and all shapes you want to use as masks
4. Run this script
5. Choose occlusion mode:
   - ⭐⠀      Add Cards:    Hide One, Guess One: Creates cards where only one shape is hidden at a time
   - ⭐⭐     Add Cards:    Hide All, Guess One: Creates cards where all shapes are hidden except one
   - 🗑️⠀      Delete Cards: Delete old cards (add DELETE marker): Marks all existing cards for deletion by adding DELETE marker
   - 🗑️💥     Delete Cards: Delete old cards file and related images (Be Cautious!! Physical Delection): Permanently deletes all related card files and images

The script will generate masked versions of the image and save them locally.

## Invert colors.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Invert colors.md -->

/*
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-invert-colors.jpg)

  

The script inverts the colors on the canvas including the color palette in Element Properties.

This script inverts all the colors in the current Excalidraw drawing. It applies the inversion to:
1. The stroke and background colors of every element on the canvas.
2. The main canvas background color.
3. All colors within the user's custom color palette, handling all possible configurations (simple arrays, nested arrays, and objects).
4. The currently selected stroke and background colors in the UI.
 
A default color palette is defined to use as a fallback if the current drawing's palette is missing or empty. // This is based on the standard Excalidraw palette from version [1.6.8.](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.6.8)

You'll find a detailed description of the color palette data structure on the [Excalidraw-Obsidian Wiki](https://excalidraw-obsidian.online/wiki/color-palette)

## Lighten background color.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Lighten background color.md -->

/*
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-download-raw.jpg)

Download this file and save to your Obsidian Vault including the first line, or open it in "Raw" and copy the entire contents to Obsidian.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/darken-lighten-background-color.png)

This script lightens the background color of the selected element by 2% at a time. 

You can use this script several times until you are satisfied. It is recommended to set a shortcut key for this script so that you can quickly try to DARKEN and LIGHTEN the color effect.

In contrast to the `Modify background color opacity` script, the advantage is that the background color of the element is not affected by the canvas color, and the color value does not appear in a strange rgba() form.

The color conversion method was copied from [color-convert](https://github.com/Qix-/color-convert).

/*

format **the left to right** mind map

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-mindmap-format-1.png)

# tree

Mind map is actually a tree, so you must have a **root node**. The script will determine **the leftmost element** of the selected element as the root element (node is excalidraw element, e.g. rectangle, diamond, ellipse, text, image, but it can't be arrow, line, freedraw, **group**)

The element connecting node and node must be an **arrow** and  have the correct direction, e.g. **parent node -> children node**

# sort

The order of nodes in the Y axis or vertical direction is determined by **the creation time** of the arrow connecting it

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-mindmap-format-2.png)

So if you want to readjust the order, you can **delete arrows and reconnect them**

# setting

Script provides options to adjust the style of mind map, The option is at the bottom of the option of the exalidraw plugin(e.g. Settings -> Community plugins -> Excalidraw -> drag to bottom)

# problem

1. since the start bingding and end bingding of the arrow are easily disconnected from the node, so if there are unformatted parts, please **check the connection** and use the script to **reformat**

## Modify background color opacity.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Modify background color opacity.md -->

/*
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-download-raw.jpg)

Download this file and save to your Obsidian Vault including the first line, or open it in "Raw" and copy the entire contents to Obsidian.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-modify-background-color-opacity.png)

This script changes the opacity of the background color of the selected boxes.

The default background color in Excalidraw is so dark that the text is hard to read. You can lighten the color a bit by setting transparency. And you can tweak the transparency over and over again until you're happy with it.

Although excalidraw has the opacity option in its native property Settings, it also changes the transparency of the border. Use this script to change only the opacity of the background color without affecting the border.

This script will reset the start and end positions of the selected arrows. The arrow will point to the center of the connected box and will have a gap of 8px from the box.

Tips: If you are drawing a flowchart, you can use `Normalize Selected Arrows` script to correct the position of the start and end points of the arrows, then use `Elbow connectors` script, and you will get the perfect connecting line!

Converts selected freedraw lines such that pencil pressure will decrease from maximum to minimum from the beginning of the line to its end. The resulting line is placed at the back of the layers, under all other items. Helpful when drawing organic mindmaps.

This is the old script from this [video](YouTube: JMcNDdj_lPs?t=479). Since it's release this has been superseded by custom pens that you can enable in plugin settings. For more on custom pens, watch [this](YouTube: OjNhjaH2KjI) 

The benefit of the approach in this implementation of custom pens is that it will look the same on excalidraw.com when you copy your drawing over for sharing with non-Obsidian users. Otherwise custom pens are faster to use and much more configurable.

```javascript
*/
let elements = ea.getViewSelectedElements().filter((el)=>["freedraw","line","arrow"].includes(el.type));
if(elements.length === 0) {
  elements = ea.getViewSelectedElements();
  const len = elements.length;
  if(len === 0 || ["freedraw","line","arrow"].includes(elements[len].type)) {
    return;
  }
  elements = [elements[len]];
} 

ea.copyViewElementsToEAforEditing(elements);

Palm Guard: A mobile-friendly drawing mode for Excalidraw that prevents accidental palm touches by hiding UI controls and entering fullscreen mode. Perfect for drawing with a stylus on tablets.

Features:
- Enters fullscreen to maximize drawing space (configurable in plugin script settings)
- Hides all UI controls to prevent accidental taps
- Provides a minimal floating toolbar with toggle visibility button
- Enables a completely distraction-free canvas even on desktop devices by hiding the main toolbar and all chrome while keeping a tiny movable toggle control (addresses immersive canvas / beyond Zen Mode request)
- Draggable toolbar can be positioned anywhere on screen
- Exit Palm Guard mode with a single tap
- Press the hotkey you configured for this script in Obsidian's Hotkey settings (e.g., ALT+X) to toggle UI visibility; if no hotkey is set, use the on-screen toggle button.

Export Excalidraw to PDF Pages: Define printable page areas using frames, then export each frame as a separate page in a multi-page PDF. Perfect for turning your Excalidraw drawings into printable notes, handouts, or booklets. Supports standard and custom page sizes, margins, and easy frame arrangement.

**Easily split your Excalidraw drawing into printable pages!**

If you find this script helpful, consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/zsolt). Thank you.

---

### How it works

- **Define Pages:** Use frames to mark out each page area in your drawing. You can create the first frame with this script (choose a standard size or orientation), or draw your own frame for a custom page size.
- **Add More Pages:** Select a frame, then use the arrow buttons to add new frames next to it. All new frames will match the size of the selected one.
- **Rename Frames:** You can rename frames as you like. When exporting to PDF, pages will be ordered alphabetically by frame name.

---

### Important Notes

- **Same Size & Orientation:** All frames must have the same size and orientation (e.g., all A4 Portrait) to export to PDF. Excalidraw currently does not support PDFs with different-sized pages.
- **Custom Sizes:** If you draw your own frame, the PDF will use that exact size—great for custom page layouts!
- **Margins:** If you set a margin, the page size stays the same, but your content will shrink to fit inside the printable area.
- **No Frame Borders/Titles in Print:** Frame borders and frame titles will *not* appear in the PDF.
- **No Frame Clipping:** The script disables frame clipping for this drawing.
- **Templates:** You can save a template document with prearranged frames (even locked ones) for reuse.
- **Lock Frames:** Frames only define print areas—they don't "contain" elements. Locking frames is recommended to prevent accidental movement.
- **Outside Content:** Anything outside the frames will *not* appear in the PDF.

---

### Printing

- **Export to PDF:** Click the printer button to export each frame as a separate page in a PDF.
- **Order:** Pages are exported in alphabetical order of frame names.

---

### Settings

You can also access script settings at the bottom of Excalidraw Plugin settings. The script stores your preferences for:
- Locking new frames after creation
- Zooming to new frames
- Closing the dialog after adding a frame
- Default page size and orientation
- Print margin

# Excalidraw Script Engine scripts library

【English | [简体中文](../docs/zh-cn/ea-scripts/README.md)】

Click to watch the intro video:

[![Script Engine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14358394/145684531-8d9c2992-59ac-4ebc-804a-4cce1777ded2.jpg)](YouTube: hePJcObHIso)

> **Warning**
> There is an easier way to install/manage scripts than what is shown in this video

See the [Excalidraw Script Engine](https://zsviczian.github.io/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/ExcalidrawScriptsEngine.html) documentation for more details.

## How to install scripts into your Obsidian Vault
To install one of the built-in scripts:
- Open up an excalidraw drawing in Obsidian
- In the pane dropdown menu select "Install or update Excalidraw Scripts"
- Click on one of the available scripts
- Click on "Install this script" (note if the script is already installed you will instead see an option to update it)
- Restart Obsidian so the script will be picked up

Note: By default this will install the script into your vault in the `Excalidraw/Scripts/Downloaded` folder

<details><summary>Manual installation of scripts</summary>

Open the script you are interested in and save it to your Obsidian Vault including the first line `/*`, or open it in "Raw" and copy the entire contents to Obsidian.

Scribble Helper can improve handwriting and add links. It lets you create and edit text elements, including wrapped text and sticky notes, by double-tapping on the canvas. When you run the script, it creates an event handler that will activate the editor when you double-tap. If you select a text element on the canvas before running the script, it will open the editor for that element. If you use a pen, you can set it up to only activate Scribble Helper when you double-tap with the pen. The event handler is removed when you run the script a second time or switch to a different tab.

This script enables the selection of elements based on matching properties. Select the attributes (such as stroke color, fill style, font family, etc) that should match for selection. It's perfect for large scenes where manual selection of elements would be cumbersome. You can either run the script to select matching elements across the entire scene, or define a specific group of elements to apply the selection criteria to.

/*
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-set-background-color-of-unclosed-line.jpg)

Use this script to set the background color of unclosed (i.e. open) line, arrow and freedraw objects by creating a clone of the object. The script will set the stroke color of the clone to transparent and will add a straight line to close the object. Use settings to define the default background color, the fill style, and the strokeWidth of the clone. By default the clone will be grouped with the original object, you can disable this also in settings.

This script modifies the color lightness/hue/saturation/transparency of selected Excalidraw elements and  SVG and nested Excalidraw drawings. Select eligible elements in the scene, then run the script.

- The color of Excalidraw elements (lines, ellipses, rectangles, etc.) will be changed by the script.
- The color of SVG elements and nested Excalidraw drawings will only be mapped. When mapping colors, the original image remains unchanged, only a mapping table is created and the image is recolored during rendering of your Excalidraw screen. In case you want to make manual changes you can also edit the mapping in Markdown View Mode under `## Embedded Files`

If you select only a single SVG or nested Excalidraw element, then the script offers an additional feature. You can map colors one by one in the image. 
```js
*/

const HELP_TEXT = `
- Select SVG images, nested Excalidraw drawings and/or regular Excalidraw elements
- For a single selected image, you can map colors individually in the color mapping section
- For Excalidraw elements: stroke and background colors are modified permanently
- For SVG/nested drawings: original files stay unchanged, color mapping is stored under \`## Embedded Files\`
- Using color maps helps maintain links between drawings while allowing different color themes
- Sliders work on relative scale - the amount of change is applied to current values
- Unlike Excalidraw's opacity setting which affects the whole element:
    - Shade Master can set different opacity for stroke vs background
    - **Note:** SVG/nested drawing colors are mapped at color name level, thus "black" is different from "#000000"
    - Additionally if the same color is used as fill and stroke the color can only be mapped once
- This is an experimental script - contributions welcome on GitHub via PRs

SVGColorInfo is returned by ea.getSVGColorInfoForImgElement. Color info will all the color strings in the SVG file plus "fill" which represents the default fill color for SVG icons set at the SVG root element level. Fill if not set defaults to black:

In the Excalidraw file under `## Embedded Files` the color map is included after the file. That color map implements ColorMap. ea.updateViewSVGImageColorMap takes a ColorMap as input.

# About the slideshow script
The script will convert your drawing into a slideshow presentation.
![Slideshow 3.0](YouTube: JwgtCrIVeEU)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-slideshow-2.jpg)
## Presentation options
- If you select an arrow or line element, the script will use that as the presentation path.
- If you select nothing, but the file has a hidden presentation path, the script will use that for determining the slide sequence.
- If there are frames, the script will use the frames for the presentation. Frames are played in alphabetical order of their titles.
# Keyboard shortcuts and modifier keys
**Forward**: Arrow Down, Arrow Right, or SPACE
**Backward**: Arrow Up, Arrow Left
**Finish presentation**: Backspace, ESC (I had issues with ESC not working in full screen presentation mode on Mac)

**Run presentation in a window**: Hold down the ALT/OPT modifier key when clicking the presentation script button
**Continue presentation**: Hold down SHIFT when clicking the presentation script button. (The feature also works in combination with the ALT/OPT modifier to start the presentation in a window). The feature will only resume while you are within the same Obsidian session (i.e. if you restart Obsidian, slideshow will no longer remember where you were). I have two use cases in mind for this feature: 
1) When you are designing your presentation you may want to test how a slide looks. Using this feature you can get back to where you left off by starting the presentation with SHIFT.
2) During presentation you may want to exit presentation mode to show something additional to your audience. You stop the presentation, show the additional thing you wanted, now you want to continue from where you left off. Hold down SHIFT when clicking the slideshow button.

## Split Ellipse.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Split Ellipse.md -->

/*

This script splits an ellipse at any point where a line intersects it. If no lines are selected, it will use every line that intersects the ellipse. Otherwise, it will only use the selected lines. If there is no intersecting line, the ellipse will be converted into a line object. 
There is also the option to close the object along the cut, which will close the cut in the shape of the line.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-splitEllipse-demo2.png)
Tip: To use an ellipse as the cutting object, you first have to use this script on it, since it will convert the ellipse into a line.


See documentation for more details:

## Text to Path.md
<!-- Source: ea-scripts/Text to Path.md -->

/*
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-text-to-path.jpg)

This script allows you to fit a text element along a selected path: line, arrow, freedraw, ellipse, rectangle, or diamond. You can select either a path or a text element, or both:

- If only a path is selected, you will be prompted to provide the text.
- If only a text element is selected and it was previously fitted to a path, the script will use the original path if it is still present in the scene.
- If both a text and a path are selected, the script will fit the text to the selected path.

If the path is a perfect circle, you will be prompted to choose whether to fit the text above or below the circle.

After fitting, the text will no longer be editable as a standard text element, but you'll be able to edit it with this script. Text on path cannot function as a markdown link. Emojis are not supported.

# Excalidraw Startup Script

ExcalidrawStartup Script can be configured in Plugin Settings under 'Excalidraw Automate'. When defined this script runs automatically when the Excalidraw plugin is loaded to Obsidian. The user can add automation tasks here that they want to run on every startup of Excalidraw in Obsidian such as defining Excalidraw event handlers (also known as hooks).

Two files follow. First the template startup script with documenation comments, then an actual startup script example with implemented functionality.
