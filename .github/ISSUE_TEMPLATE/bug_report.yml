description: When something is clearly broken. Everything else is a feature request or a support request. While no doubt there are many bugs in the plugin, please do proper due dilligence before declaring that something is a "bug". I find that most of the "bugs" reported are either how-to questions or feature requests.

        ⚠️ **Important: Please Read Before Submitting a Bug Report** ⚠️

        I am a one-person team working on this plugin as a part-time hobby. I cannot handle a flood of poorly documented issues. **To ensure your report is considered, you must follow these guidelines**. If you don't, I will close the issue without review.

        Before creating a bug report, please:
        1. **Review recent [release notes](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases)** – maybe there is already an answer.
        2. **[Search issues](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues) (including closed ones)** to see if there is anything similar.
